### 🌐 Introduction

ILPIs (Long-Term Care Institutions for the Elderly) take care of those who need it most, but they face a silent crisis: lack of liquidity. They rely on future monthly payments, have no access to credit, and often delay salaries and essential supplies.

Our solution turns these receivables into tokens via blockchain, allowing ILPIs to securely access upfront capital. Investors acquire impact-backed assets, guided by an AI that assesses the risk of each operation.

---

### BNB Chain

Our platform is built on the BNB Chain, a scalable, secure blockchain with low transaction fees. Choosing BNB Chain allows us to provide an accessible and efficient infrastructure—ideal for democratizing credit access for long-term care institutions and attracting investors worldwide.

With its wide adoption and smart contract compatibility, BNB Chain ensures speed, transparency, and trust at every stage of receivables tokenization.

<summary>🌟 Features</summary>

### 🔹 Receivables Tokenization  
Long-term care institutions (ILPIs) register their future receivables on the platform, which are converted into tradable tokens on the blockchain.

### 🔹 Investment Marketplace  
Investors access a curated marketplace of receivable-backed tokens, evaluating opportunities based on risk and expected returns.

### 🔹 AI-Powered Risk Scoring  
A proprietary AI model analyzes each receivable and assigns a risk score (low, medium, or high), based on factors such as the ILPI’s history, guarantees, and payment terms.

### 🔹 Generative AI Interpretation  
After the score is calculated, a second AI layer generates clear, human-readable explanations of each token's strengths and risks to guide investor decisions.

### 🔹 Powered by BNB Chain  
All operations are transparently, immutably, and automatically recorded via smart contracts on the BNB Chain, ensuring trust and scalability.

## 🌈 Future Roadmap

Our roadmap includes implementing an oracle that connects the blockchain to real-world data, validating in real-time the legitimacy of receivables based on:

- Financial systems of ILPIs  
- Registered invoices  
- Proof of relationship with family members/payers  
- Institution’s payment history
